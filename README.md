  # _Beep Boop Simulator_

  #### _User puts in an input, beep and boops comes out, Oct 26, 2018_

  #### By _**Miles Bradt**_

  ## Description

  _The user is asked to input a number, when the number is submitted the program will count by 1 up until that number is reached. Once it's finished counting, any number with 0 will be replaced with "Beep!", any number with a 1 will be replaced with "Boop!", and any number divisible by 3 will be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"_

_(These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!", and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.")_
